# Data Sampling 
### *Learnt About*
  * *In this class we learned about the sampling distribution.*
  * *To add trace on graph we can use **add_trace**.*
  * *.**sampling mean = 1/10 of Population Standard deviation.**

### *Steps To Find sampling distribution*
  * *We got a data which didnâ€™t follow normal distribution and then we plotted it*
  * *We saw that the distribution was not normal*
  * *We also saw the mean of the distribution and added trace of the mean.*
  * *We took the sample of 100 data points and got its mean and standard deviation.*
  * *Then we calculated the mean of the 100 random data points 1000 times and plotted it on the graph.*
  * *Then we calculated the mean of the sampling data and added a trace for the mean.*
  * *Then we calculated the standard deviation of the sample mean*
  * *We concluded that the Standard deviation of the sampling mean = 1/10 of Population Standard deviation.*
  * *. We tried the same with the different set of data.*
